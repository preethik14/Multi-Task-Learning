# Multi-Task-Learning
Multi Task Learning for Detection of lung sounds and lung diseases with a single input feature vector. We have extended our work to the architecture of 2D CNN, DenseNet, MobileNet and ResNet.
Our work uses ICBHI Dataset which contains lung sounds and lung diseases annotated. MFCC Features are calculated using audio files and then fed to the multi-tasking deep learning models.
